# Analyze Distances Extension

This extension allows visually comparing images of top-k embeddings. Instead of uploading the embeddings which can become very memory consuming, distances to query image embeddings in NPZ format are taken. The embeddings are linked with the image files using a JSON file.

Example JSON and embedding NPZ files for Oxford Robotcar Dataset can be found [here](/docs/attachments/extensions/distances/robotcar_embeddings.zip)
