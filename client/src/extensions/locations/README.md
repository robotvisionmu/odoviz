# Analyze Locations Extension

This extension helps visualize a trajectory split into multiple topological nodes or locations using [HTMap](https://github.com/emiliofidalgo/htmap). Results generated by HTMap can be uploaded to get visualizations applied on the currently loaded trajectory.

An example HTMAP results files are available [here](/docs/attachments/extensions/locations/htmap_results.zip)

Further, it shows loops found between locations which can be combined with `settings.offset.timeOnZAxis` to get interesting visualizations
